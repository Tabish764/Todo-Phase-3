# Data Model: Frontend-Backend Integration

## Task Entity

### Properties
- **id** (string): Unique identifier for the task (generated by backend)
- **title** (string): Task title, 1-200 characters
- **description** (string, optional): Task description, can be null
- **completed** (boolean): Completion status, default false
- **created_at** (string, ISO date): Timestamp when task was created
- **updated_at** (string, ISO date): Timestamp when task was last updated

### Validation Rules
- Title must be 1-200 characters (enforced by backend)
- Title is required for creation
- Completed defaults to false if not specified
- All timestamp fields are read-only (set by backend)

### State Transitions
- New task: `completed: false` (default)
- Task update: Can transition `completed` from false to true or vice versa
- Task deletion: Removed from backend storage

## API Request/Response Models

### Create Task Request
```json
{
  "title": "string (1-200 chars)",
  "description": "string (optional)"
}
```

### Update Task Request
```json
{
  "title": "string (1-200 chars, optional)",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "completed": "boolean (optional)"
}
```

### Task Response
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string (or null)",
  "completed": "boolean",
  "created_at": "ISO date string",
  "updated_at": "ISO date string"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "detail": "error message"
}
```

## Frontend State Model
The frontend will maintain tasks in a similar structure to the backend response, with additional UI state as needed:

```javascript
{
  id: "string",
  title: "string",
  description: "string (or null)",
  completed: "boolean",
  created_at: "ISO date string",
  updated_at: "ISO date string",
  // Additional UI state properties as needed
  isLoading?: "boolean",
  error?: "string"
}
```
